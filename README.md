Things added since forking:

1. Turned Pattern Storage 180 degrees when placing so the front is facing you, like all other machines.
2. Updated all machines to accept the Matter Network Cable from any side, not just the back.

Issues:

1. Attempted to get matter storage pipes to attach to more than just the back of the replicator. It connects, but nothing transfers.

Todo:

1. Allow energy transfer across matter network cables. That way connectivity and power go over one set of cables.
2. Make the microwave able to "cook" food like furnaces do, getting power from RF. If ores are put in the microwave, make it explode.
